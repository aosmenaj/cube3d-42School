**cube3d** is a project from the 42 curriculum that focuses on 3D graphics and interaction within a 3D space. The goal of the project is to build a 3D rendering engine in C using the **MiniLibX** library. The game simulates a 3D cube environment where the player can move around and interact with the cube.

This project requires an understanding of basic 3D geometry, 3D projection, user input handling, and graphics rendering in an X11 window.

## üöÄ Project Goal

The goal of **cube3d** is to create a basic 3D game engine that allows the player to explore a 3D environment in real-time. The project teaches:

- How to build a 3D scene, rendering objects (like a cube) using 3D projections.
- How to handle user input for movement in a 3D space.
- How to implement graphics rendering with the MiniLibX library.
- The fundamentals of 3D geometry and the math behind 3D rendering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

To try the game, run:

```bash
make
./cub3D maps/basement.cub
